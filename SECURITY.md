# Security Policy (But Make It Fun)

## Supported Versions
We only provide security updates for the latest and greatest version in the `main` branch. If you're using an older version, well... good luck out there.

| Version | Supported? |
| ------- | ---------- |
| > 1.0.0 | ✅ Absolutely! |
| < 1.0.0 | ❌ Nope, you're on your own. |

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
So, you found a security issue? First of all, congrats on being awesome! Here's what to do next:

1. **Keep It Secret, Keep It Safe:** Don't go shouting about it in public issues. We don't want the bad guys to know!
2. **Slide Into My Inbox:** Send a detailed email to [your-email@example.com]. Bonus points if you include memes.
3. **Patience, Young Padawan:** I'll try to respond within 48 hours. If I don't, feel free to send a polite nudge (or a funny GIF).
4. **Fix It, Felix Style:** I'll work on a plan to patch things up faster than you can say "buffer overflow."

## Principles
This project is guarded by the mighty powers of GitHub Secret Scanning and Dependabot. If any secrets accidentally slip out (oops!), they’ll be revoked and replaced faster than you can refresh your browser. AWS Console is our fortress, and we don’t mess around.

Stay safe, stay secure, and may your code always compile on the first try!
